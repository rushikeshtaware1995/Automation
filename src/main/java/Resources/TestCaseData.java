So to recover these drawbacks, automation testing came into existence. With automation testing, developers or testers keep everything in their hands, boosting the product's productivity.Manual testing is best suitable for usability testing, Ad-hoc testing and usability testing. In contrast, automation testing is best suited for areas like load testing, regression testing, repeated execution and performance testing. Automation helps companies take new features to market instantly in the testing world and ensure a bug-free user experience.\"Automation testing refers to the automatic testing of the software in which developer or tester write the test script once with the help of testing tools and framework and run it on the software. The test script automatically test the software without human intervention and shows the result (either error, bugs are present or software is free from them).Automation testing needs manual effort when creating initial scripts, and further process is performed automatically to compare the actual testing result with expected results. This can be performed at these levels a) unit-level automation, b) API testing c) user interface.";
